# Graphics for Roc (WIP)

This is a graphics platform for Roc copied from [roc-lang/examples](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/examples/gui) to experiment with new features. 

My goal is to learn more about Roc dev; to explore ideas for the Roc editor, and how to do [Action-State in Roc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16qY4NGVOHu8mvInVD-ddTajZYSsFvFBvQON_hmyHGfo/edit#).
