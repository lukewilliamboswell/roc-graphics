# Graphics platform for Roc (WIP)

This is a graphics platform for Roc copied from [roc-lang/examples](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/examples/gui) so that I can experiment with new features. 

My goal is to learn more about Roc dev; to explore ideas for the Roc editor, and how to do [Action-State in Roc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16qY4NGVOHu8mvInVD-ddTajZYSsFvFBvQON_hmyHGfo/edit#).

**Any feedback or assistance is most welcome!**

## Building a release 

> `roc build --bundle .tar.br platform/main.roc`
